💡 **Tip for Screenshot (Hero Page):**
After creating this project:

1. Open your **Projects Overview** page — it’ll show all stages with neat progress bars and priorities.
2. Open the **Analytics** tab to show your summary cards and charts.
3. Take a screenshot of both (maybe crop to focus on the dashboard area).
4. Use that in your hero section to visually showcase “live project tracking.”
