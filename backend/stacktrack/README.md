# 🧠 StackTrack Backend

This is the **backend API** for **StackTrack**, a project management and tracking platform built with **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.

It provides RESTful endpoints for managing projects, stages, and tasks, along with analytics for project progress and task statistics. The API is structured for modular scalability and upcoming features such as user performance insights, notifications, and enhanced task management.

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

* The **slug** field is automatically generated from the project title.
* The **owner** field links each project to the authenticated user.
* **Nested routers** enforce hierarchical endpoints and ensure proper parent-child associations.
* JWT authentication secures all API requests; include `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` in headers.
* Analytics endpoints provide project progress and task stats dynamically.
